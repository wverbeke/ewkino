**Branch of ewkino for fakerate measurement for 4-tops analysis**  

Original lepton selections copied from Niels on 29/11/2021.  
This branch of the ewkino framework is meant to be used (only) for FO definition optimization and fake rate measurement in simulation and data in the context of his 4-tops search.  
It does not contain any other 4-tops analysis code.
