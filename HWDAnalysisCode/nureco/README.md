Tools for neutrino reconstruction.

Consider the situation where a resonance R decays 
into a measurable particle A and a neutrino N:
R -> A + N

Expressed in four-vectors:
pR = pA + pN
(pR)^2 = (pA + pN)^2
mR^2 = mA^2 + 2pA.pN

Assumptions:
- the mass of the resonance mR is known.
- all components of pA can be measured with sufficient precision.
- the transverse components of the missing energy can be measured with sufficient precision.
- this neutrino is (approximately) the only source of missing energy in the event.

Under these assumptions, the neutrino z-momentum 
is the only one unknown variable in the equation above,
and can be extracted by solving a quadratic equation.
