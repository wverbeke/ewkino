Preliminary analysis scripts for analysis of rare Higgs decay to W + Ds.

Creation of this project.
Motivation: 
A first step in the analysis consists of reproducing the results of AN2017-235
(see also notes from August 24 up to now).
The ntuplizer has been extended with DAnalyzer (and DGenAnalyzer but not relevant) 
in order to copy the workflow of this AN. 
This project is supposed to contain some plotting functionality for investigating the output files
that goes slightly beyond rootbrowser.

Merging of this process under a newly created branch of ewkino.
Just to have all code in the same spot, this code is supposed to not rely on the framework at all.
Simply moved the folder here and added to git.
Will probably be used less and less often, 
in favour of equivalent but more flexible functionality (yet to be created) in ewkino.
