**Scripts to study higgs boson reconstruction**

More specifically: study different ways of choosing the neutrino 
and corresponding higgs boson candidate. 
Try to check which methods give the best mass peak without biasing the background.
The method that turns out best should then be used in the eventFlattening script.
